# Whats's Cooking

This is just a showcase app using [spoonacular.com](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
The app has just two screens, one screen with the list of recipes by ingredient and a second screen with detailed view of the recipe.
There is also an autocomplete functionality for adding ingredients.
